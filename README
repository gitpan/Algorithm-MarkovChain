Algorithm::MarkovChain, version 0.01

This module implements a class capable of creating a Markov chain, amd
then generating output based on it.

For more complete documentation consult the POD within the class file.

This module should work with Perl 5.005_03 and later (I am currently
unable to test beyond this, but would appreciate feedback/bug reports
to enable this to be improved upon)

Enjoy!  <richardc@unixbeard.net>
